# 0. Introduction to SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a powerful and flexible SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. It provides a set of high-level API for connecting to relational databases, executing SQL queries, and mapping database tables to Python classes (ORM).

## Key Features
- **Database Abstraction:** Supports multiple database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) with the same codebase.
- **ORM:** Allows you to interact with your database using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.
- **Core and ORM:** SQLAlchemy consists of two main components:
  - **SQLAlchemy Core:** Provides a schema-centric, lower-level API for constructing SQL queries and schema definitions.
  - **SQLAlchemy ORM:** Provides a higher-level, object-oriented API for mapping database tables to Python classes.
- **Migrations:** Integrates with Alembic for database schema migrations.
- **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manages database connections.

## Why Use SQLAlchemy?
- Simplifies database interactions in Python applications.
- Reduces the need to write raw SQL queries.
- Makes code more maintainable and portable across different databases.

SQLAlchemy is widely used in web development, data analysis, and any Python application that requires robust database interaction.
