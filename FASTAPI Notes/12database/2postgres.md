# PostgreSQL Overview

## What is PostgreSQL?

- **PostgreSQL** (often called "Postgres") is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system.
- Known for its reliability, feature set, and performance.
- Supports advanced data types, full ACID compliance, and extensibility.

---

## Key Features

- **Open Source & Free**: No licensing costs.
- **ACID Compliant**: Ensures data integrity (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- **Extensible**: Supports custom data types, functions, and extensions (like PostGIS for GIS data).
- **Advanced SQL Support**: Window functions, CTEs, JSON, arrays, and more.
- **Strong Security**: Role-based authentication, SSL, and encryption options.
- **Concurrency**: Uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) for high performance with many users.

## Common Use Cases

- Web applications (Django, FastAPI, Rails, etc.)
- Data analytics and warehousing
- Geospatial data (with PostGIS)
- Financial and scientific applications

## Connecting FastAPI to PostgreSQL

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2
   ```
2. **Example connection string:**
   ```python
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname"
   ```
3. **Use SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` to connect.**

## Best Practices

- Always use environment variables or a `.env` file for credentials.
- Use migrations (like Alembic) to manage schema changes.
- Regularly back up your database.
- Monitor performance and tune configuration as needed.
