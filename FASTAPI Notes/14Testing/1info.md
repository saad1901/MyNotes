# What is Testing? (Overview)

- **Testing** is the process of verifying that your code works as expected and is free of bugs.
- It helps ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in your application.
- In software development, testing is essential for catching errors early, preventing regressions, and making code changes safer.

## Why is Testing Important?
- **Catches bugs early** before they reach production.
- **Prevents regressions** (old features breaking after new changes).
- **Documents expected behavior** of your code.
- **Enables refactoring** and adding new features with confidence.
- **Improves code quality** and reliability.

## Types of Testing
- **Unit Testing:** Test individual functions or classes in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Test how different parts of your application work together.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Test the entire application flow, simulating real user scenarios.
- **Manual Testing:** Human-driven, exploratory testing.

## Testing in Python
- Common frameworks: `pytest`, `unittest`, `nose`.
- For FastAPI: Use `pytest` and FastAPI's `TestClient` for API testing.
