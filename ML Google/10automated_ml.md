# 10. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

## What is AutoML?
- AutoML refers to tools and techniques that automate parts of the machine learning workflow.
- It aims to make ML accessible to non-experts and speed up model development for experts.

## Key Concepts
- **Automation Scope**: Can include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces manual effort and expertise required.
  - Can find better models or configurations than manual search.
  - Speeds up experimentation and deployment.
- **Limitations**:
  - May not handle highly specialized or novel problems well.
  - Less transparency and control over model details.

## Steps in AutoML
1. Input data and define the prediction task.
2. AutoML system preprocesses data and selects features.
3. System tries multiple models and tunes hyperparameters.
4. Best model is selected and can be deployed.

## Example Use Cases
- Rapid prototyping of ML solutions.
- Businesses without in-house ML expertise.
- Large-scale experimentation.
