# 8. Large Language Models (LLMs)

## What are Large Language Models?
- LLMs are advanced neural networks trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language.
- They use architectures like Transformers to process and generate text.

## Key Concepts
- **Tokens**: Basic units of text (words, subwords, or characters).
- **Transformer Architecture**: Uses self-attention to model relationships between all tokens in a sequence.
- **Pre-training**: Model learns general language patterns from large text corpora.
- **Fine-tuning**: Model is further trained on specific tasks or domains.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting input prompts to guide model outputs.
- **Distillation**: Creating smaller, efficient models from large ones.

## How LLMs Work
1. Input text is tokenized.
2. Model processes tokens using layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.
3. Output is generated token by token, based on learned patterns.

## Example Use Cases
- Text generation (chatbots, story writing).
- Summarization, translation, question answering.
- Code generation, sentiment analysis.

## Visual Intuition
- LLMs can generate coherent, context-aware text by predicting the next token in a sequence.
- They can be adapted to many language tasks with minimal additional training.
