# 0. Introduction to Machine Learning (Google ML Crash Course)

## What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning (ML) is a way to train software, called a model, to make predictions or generate content using data.
- ML powers many technologies: translation apps, self-driving cars, recommendations, autocomplete, summarization, and more.
- Instead of hard-coding rules, ML learns patterns from data.

## Types of Machine Learning Systems
1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Learns from labeled data (data with correct answers).
   - Main tasks: Regression (predicting numbers) and Classification (predicting categories).
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Learns from unlabeled data (no correct answers provided).
   - Main task: Clustering (finding groups/patterns in data).
3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Used in robotics, games, etc.
4. **Generative AI**
   - Learns to generate new content (text, images, music, etc.) by mimicking patterns in data.

## Key Terms
- **Model**: The mathematical representation learned from data.
- **Training**: The process of learning from data.
- **Prediction**: The output of a trained model given new data.
- **Regression**: Predicting a numeric value.
- **Classification**: Predicting a category.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points.
- **Policy**: In reinforcement learning, the strategy for choosing actions.

## Example: Predicting Rainfall
- Traditional: Use physics and equations to model weather.
- ML: Feed lots of weather data to a model, which learns the relationship between conditions and rainfall.

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised
- **Supervised**: Data has correct answers; model learns to predict them.
- **Unsupervised**: No correct answers; model finds structure/patterns.

## Generative AI Examples
- Text-to-text: Summarization, translation.
- Text-to-image: Creating images from descriptions.
- Text-to-video, text-to-code, image-to-text, etc.
