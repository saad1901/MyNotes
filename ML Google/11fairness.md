# 11. Fairness in Machine Learning

## What is Fairness in ML?
- Fairness in ML means ensuring that models do not produce biased or discriminatory outcomes for individuals or groups.
- It is critical for responsible AI, especially in sensitive domains (e.g., hiring, lending, healthcare).

## Key Concepts
- **Types of Bias**: Systematic errors that disadvantage certain groups (e.g., gender, race, age).
- **Identifying Bias**: Analyzing model predictions for disparities across groups.
- **Mitigating Bias**: Techniques to reduce bias, such as rebalancing data, adjusting model training, or post-processing outputs.
- **Evaluating for Bias**: Using metrics like demographic parity, equality of opportunity, and counterfactual fairness.

## Steps to Ensure Fairness
1. Analyze data for representation and potential sources of bias.
2. Monitor model predictions for disparate impact.
3. Apply mitigation strategies as needed.
4. Continuously evaluate and update models.

## Example Use Cases
- Loan approval systems: Avoiding discrimination based on protected attributes.
- Healthcare diagnostics: Ensuring equal accuracy across demographic groups.

## Visual Intuition
- Fair models should perform equally well for all relevant groups.
- Regular audits and transparency are essential for trust.
