# Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are managed by Docker and are stored outside the container's filesystem.

## Why Use Volumes?
- Persist data even if the container is removed.
- Share data between containers.
- Decouple storage from the container lifecycle.

## Types of Volumes
- **Named volumes:** Managed by Docker, created with a name.
- **Anonymous volumes:** Created without a name, often used for temporary data.
- **Host volumes (bind mounts):** Map a specific directory or file from the host to the container.

## Common Volume Commands
- **Create a volume:**
  ```sh
  docker volume create myvolume
  ```
- **List volumes:**
  ```sh
  docker volume ls
  ```
- **Inspect a volume:**
  ```sh
  docker volume inspect myvolume
  ```
- **Remove a volume:**
  ```sh
  docker volume rm myvolume
  ```
- **Mount a volume to a container:**
  ```sh
  docker run -v myvolume:/data ubuntu
  ```
- **Bind mount a host directory:**
  ```sh
  docker run -v /host/path:/container/path ubuntu
  ```

## Best Practices
- Use named volumes for persistent data.
- Clean up unused volumes regularly.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in volumes unless encrypted.
