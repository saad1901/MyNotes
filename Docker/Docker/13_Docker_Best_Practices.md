# Docker Best Practices

## Development
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from builds.
- Keep Dockerfiles simple and readable.
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
- Use environment variables for configuration.

## Building Images
- Use official base images when possible.
- Pin versions for base images and dependencies.
- Combine commands with `&&` to minimize layers.
- Clean up temporary files and package caches in the same layer.
- Minimize the number of layers and image size.

## Running Containers
- Run containers as non-root users.
- Use health checks to monitor container status.
- Limit container resource usage (CPU, memory).
- Use named volumes for persistent data.
- Use custom networks for isolation.

## Security
- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities.
- Limit container capabilities.
- Use secrets management for sensitive data.

## Maintenance
- Remove unused images, containers, and volumes regularly.
- Monitor container and host resource usage.
