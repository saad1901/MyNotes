# Docker Security

Security is crucial when working with containers. Docker provides several features and best practices to enhance security.

## Best Practices
- Use official and trusted images.
- Regularly update images and containers.
- Minimize the number of running processes in containers.
- Run containers as non-root users whenever possible.
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive data.
- Limit container capabilities using `--cap-drop` and `--cap-add`.
- Use read-only file systems for containers when possible.
- Scan images for vulnerabilities (e.g., `docker scan`).

## User Management
- Avoid running containers as root.
- Use the `USER` instruction in Dockerfile to specify a non-root user.
- Limit access to the Docker daemon (only trusted users should have access).

## Image Security
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size and attack surface.
- Remove unnecessary packages and files from images.
- Sign images and use content trust (`DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1`).

## Network Security
- Use custom networks to isolate containers.
- Restrict published ports to only those necessary.
- Use firewalls and security groups to control access.
