# Introduction to Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers allow developers to package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring consistency across multiple environments.

## History of Docker
- **2013:** Docker was released as an open-source project by dotCloud (now Docker, Inc.).
- **Solomon Hykes** is the founder of Docker.
- Docker revolutionized software development by making containers easy to use and accessible to everyone.

## Core Concepts
- **Image:** A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
- **Container:** A runtime instance of an image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
- **Docker Engine:** The core software that hosts and runs the containers.
- **Docker Hub:** A cloud-based registry for sharing Docker images.
- **Dockerfile:** A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

## Why Use Docker?
- Consistency across environments
- Isolation and security
- Efficient resource utilization
